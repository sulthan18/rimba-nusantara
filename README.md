# rimba-nusantara - Event Ticket Booking Platform

rimba-nusantara is a full-stack web application built using the MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js) for purchasing tickets to offline/online events. Inspired by platforms like Eventbrite and Loket, rimba-nusantara provides a seamless experience for event organizers and participants to manage and book events.

This project is designed to help you become a Full-Stack JavaScript Developer by diving deep into the MERN Stack technologies. You will learn to build a robust application with features like user role management (using JWT), Single Page Application (SPA) development, and server-side rendering. By the end of this project, you will have a portfolio-ready application that meets industry standards.
